const dummyText = `INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Joseph is washing the dishes. Daniel enters. Sees Joseph. Stops, obviously confused.

Joseph turns around.

JOSEPH
Hey there, how’s it going?

DANIEL
Who are you?
(pause)
I have never seen you before.

JOSEPH
I’m your roommate...

DANIEL
Really?

JOSEPH
Yeah. Since five years...

DANIEL
Ah... cool.

An awkward pause.

JOSEPH
So...
(beat)
You didn’t take your memory pills, huh?

DANIEL
I don’t want to. They make my skin itchy...

JOSEPH
You really should take them.

DANIEL
(angry)
Don’t tell me what to do! You’re not my MOM!

JOSEPH
Uh...

DANIEL
Wait...

Thinks for a moment.

DANIEL
Are you my mom?

Joseph sighs.`;
