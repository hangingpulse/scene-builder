import React from "react";

function SceneEditor() {
    return <div></div>;
}

export default SceneEditor;

/* 
PURPOSE:
The user can directly edit and fine tune the animation part of the scene here


NEXT STEPS:
Display the Speechbubbles as a list and build in an editmode to change text, duration and delay.
Build in a character selection menu

SMALLER COMPONENTS:
- Characters at the top (how many?)
-AddCharacterButton
- DialogueList 


TO CONSIDER:
How many characters can be in one scene (prob not more than 4)
