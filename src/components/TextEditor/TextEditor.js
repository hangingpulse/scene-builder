/* 
PURPOSE:
The user can copy paste screenplay scenes in here and also edit them as text. 
On Save they will be automatically turned into a  scene object and a first animation.

NEXT STEPS:
Research building text editor with React
Research regular Expressions for text parsing and automatic formatting

SMALLER COMPONENTS:
- Textarea
- Save Button
- Copy and Paste Buttons (Import Button if I can figure out how to import Markdown Files)
- Formatting Buttons
- Optionally: a small guide how the editor works.
